1- I need to check if its a texture check if line starts with NO WE EA SO 
2- parse texture line by cleaning the spaces to point to the path after NO WE EA OR SO 
3- assign texture 

we check if the for the color is it F OR C 

"  NO   ./textures/north_wall.xpm  "
is texture line true return 1
get texture path points to ./textures/north_wall.xpm
validate_texture_file() → Tries to open the file
assign_texture() ______  Sets game->north_texture = "./textures/north_wall.xpm


and for a line like "F 220,100,0"
trim_whitespace() → "F 220,100,0"
is_color_line() → Returns 1 (true)
get_color_part() → Points to "220,100,0"
parse_color_values() → Parses RGB values into game->floor_color[]
